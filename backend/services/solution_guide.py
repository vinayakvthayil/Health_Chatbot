{
    "step": step_number,
    "title": step_title,
    "description": detailed_description,
    "action_items": [
        list_of_actions
    ]
}

Progress Tracking:
{
    "user_id": identifier,
    "solution_id": solution_reference,
    "current_step": step_number,
    "status": completion_status,
    "timestamp": tracking_date
}

Features:
1. Solution Guide:
   - Structured steps
   - Clear descriptions
   - Actionable items
   - Progress monitoring

- Database integration pending
- Basic structure implemented
- Expandable framework
- Future enhancement ready

Usage Example:
service = SolutionGuideService(db_manager)
steps = service.get_solution_steps('sleep', 'insomnia')
progress = service.track_progress(user_id, solution_id, step, status)

Note: This service provides the foundation for guided
solutions and progress tracking as specified in the MVP
requirements.
